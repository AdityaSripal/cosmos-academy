# presentations
Find here all the slides, notes, material used for Cosmos-related conferences, presentations, meetups, workshops, etc. 

## Naming Convention
Please follow the naming convention. When adding slides to this repository, create a separate folder and name it as follows:
'''
YYYY-MM-DD-eventtitlealltogetherinlowercase-locationlocation
2018-03-10-ethcc-paris # for example
2018-05-08-blockchainsummitlatam-santiagodechile # for example for multiword events and locations
'''
Inside the folder, besides the slides in .pdf, feel free to include notes and additional material (consider file sizes)
*NOTE*: If you want to change the naming convention, make sure you open a PR and you are responsible to change all the previous files to keep consistency.

## Commit to Master vs PR
I'd say, unless you're changing any conventions, it's ok to push directly to `master` only for this repository.
