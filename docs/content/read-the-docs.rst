Read The Docs
=============

Three core repositories have their documentation hosted on individual `Read The Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__ sites. This allows the docs to be versioned alongside the code itself. As well, each of these projects is sufficiently independent to merit their own documentation.

Docs are built from the ``docs/`` directory in a respective repository. From within that directory you can run ``make html`` to build the docs then ``open _build/html/index.html`` to browse them locally.
