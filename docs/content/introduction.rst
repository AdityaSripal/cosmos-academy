Introduction
============

The goal of this academy is to provide enough resources for people to get started with Cosmos and Tendermint. If you are a developer and are just getting into the blockchain space the academy is the first stop where you can learn everything about blockchains and how to build on top of Cosmos and Tendermint developer tools.

The Cosmos Academy Program consists in two main courses:

1. **Introduction to the Cosmos Ecosystem**: aims to teach a high level overview about Cosmos and Tendermint and the protocols (IBC and ABCI) that allow interoperability between zones and the blockchain stack respectively.
2. **Cosmos for Developers**: teaches you how to install, use and deploy the different developer tools from Cosmos and Tendermint and how they interact with each other.
