Tendermint & Cosmos
===================

We are building a lot of software under two different GitHub organizations:

- `Tendermint <https://github.com/tendermint>`__ and,
- `Cosmos <https://github.com/cosmos>`__

Below, you'll find a links to the documentation of the core repositories then a list of relevant repositories in order of decreasing importance.

Read The Docs
-------------

Three core repositories have their documentation hosted on individual `Read The Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__ sites. This allows the docs to be versioned alongside the code itself. As well, each of these projects is sufficiently independent to merit their own documentation.

- http://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/
- http://ethermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/
- http://cosmos-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/master/

Docs are built from the ``docs/`` directory in a project's respective repository. From within that directory you can run ``make html`` to build the docs then ``open _build/html/index.html`` to browse them locally.
