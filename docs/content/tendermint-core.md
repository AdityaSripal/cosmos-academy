# Tendermint Core

Tendermint Core is an application-agnostic “consensus engine” that can turn any deterministic blackbox application into a distributed replicated blockchain. It allows you to create your own Application \(any deterministic state machine\) and run it on top of Tendermint Core, which aims to make it easier for developers to create blockchain protocols and applications without worrying about the Consensus and Networking layers.

Tendermint Core connects to blockchain applications via the Application Blockchain Interface \(ABCI\)
